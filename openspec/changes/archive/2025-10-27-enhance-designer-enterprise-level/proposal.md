## Why
The current Designer page has persistent drag issues and lacks enterprise-level features required for commercial workflow management. Users cannot smoothly pan the canvas or reliably drag nodes, and missing features like undo/redo, validation, and export prevent professional use.

## What Changes
- Fix canvas panning and node dragging reliability
- Implement undo/redo system for all actions
- Add keyboard shortcuts (delete, copy/paste, select all)
- Add real-time process validation with error highlighting
- Support JSON export/import of process definitions
- Enhance UI with professional styling, grid snapping, and alignment guides
- Add zoom controls and mini-map for large processes
- **BREAKING**: May change internal data structures for better performance

## Impact
- Affected specs: process-designer (extensive modifications)
- Affected code: Major refactor of src/views/Designer.vue, new utility modules, potential new dependencies
- Requires testing across browsers and devices
- May need backend integration for save/load operations
